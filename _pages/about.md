* I am a Ph.D student in the [Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering](http://www.ece.unm.edu) at [University of New Mexico, USA](http://www.unm.edu), since August 2019, as a member of the PROTON lab with [Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou](http://ece-research.unm.edu/tsiropoulou/index.html) as an advisor. 
* My major field of research is Computer Systems and Networks, which lies in the general area of game theory, particularly in contract theory and satisfaction-aware games, and reinforcement learning, as well as their applications in network science, public safety, and distributed decision making.
* I received my Bachelor's Degree from the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of New Mexico, USA, in May 2019.
